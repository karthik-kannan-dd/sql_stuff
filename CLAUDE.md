# Introduction
This is a directory where we run sql queries and store their results so that i can reference and query them back later.

Each file must be an MD file, containing sql queries and their results. You can multiple sql queries in a single file. Name the files appropriately so we know what we're doing in the files so we can reference them. 

Use the snowflake tool `snow` for all your querying. It should be configured correctly for your use, if not raise a flag.

Once you do analysis, restrict yourself to talking about the results and insights. Do not give recommendations or opine about the nature of deliveries, unless explicitly asked. For example: Do not talk about what could be causing the fraud, or how to address it. 

# Table Schemas
Table schemas will be present in the table_schemas folder. If you find that one doesn't exist for a table we're querying, describe it first and add the schema to the corresponding MD file.  Reference the table schema while querying it to verify if you're using the right columns.
